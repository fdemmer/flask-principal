"""Signal sent when the identity for a request has been changed.

Actual name: ``identity-changed``

Authentication providers should send this signal when authentication has been
successfully performed. Principal connects to this signal and causes the
identity to be saved in the session.

For example::

    from flaskext.principal import Identity, identity_changed

    def login_view(req):
        uid = req.form.get('username')
        # check the credentials

"""Signal sent when the identity has been initialised for a request.

Identity information providers can connect to this signal to perform two
major activities (in addition to what the identity loader already may have done):

    1. Populate the identity object with the necessary authorization provisions.
    2. Load any additional user information.

For example::

    from flaskext.principal import identity_loaded, RolePermit, UserPermit

    @identity_loaded.connect
    def on_identity_loaded(sender, identity):
        # Get the user information from the db
