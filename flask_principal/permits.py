"""
Permits are what was previously called "needs". An identity may carry a number
of permits and a ressource may require certain permits to allow access.

For most simple tasks tuples are perfect as permits.

Other applications may need more than that or you might just be more 
comfortable working with classes. The important part is, that permits 
must be hashable and comparable. They must at least implement the ``__hash__`` 
and ``__eq__`` functions.

    Use :class:`SimplePermit` to set any number of keywords arguments. The hash
    for comparison will be generated on a dictionary generated from those
    key/value pairs. Only keyword arguments are allowed.

    If you use "key" and "value" arguments, a :class:`SimplePermit` is also
    comparable to a :class:`FunctionPermit`. That way you can for example define
    the permits of an :class:`Identity` using :class:`SimplePermit`::

        # create identity for user with uid 1000
        identity = Identity(1000)
        # identity is owner of a eg. blog post with id 1234
        identity.add_permit(SimplePermit(key='owner', value='1234'))
        # identity is friend of user with id 5678
        identity.add_permit(SimplePermit(key='friend', value='5678'))

    ... and then a :class:`FunctionPermit` is used to check the access within the
    request context of a view function. The function is evaluated
    to determine the value of "value" when :func:`Permission.allows()` 
    is called (which happens when using :func:`Permission.required()`)::

        owner = Permission(FunctionPermit(key='owner', 
            func=lambda: request.view_args.get('post_id')))

                # edit post

        friend = Permission(FunctionPermit(key='friend', 
            func=lambda: request.view_args.get('user_id')))
