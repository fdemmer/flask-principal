Permits are what was previously called "needs". An identity may carry a number
of permits and a ressource may require certain permits to allow access.

For most simple tasks tuples are perfect as Permits.

Other applications may need more than that or you might just be more 
comfortable working with class instances. The important part is, that permits 
must be hashable and comparable. They must at least implement the __hash__ 
and __eq__ functions.
